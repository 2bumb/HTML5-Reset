# HTML5 Reset

HTML5 Reset is a simple set of best practices to get web projects off on the right foot.

## STREAMLINED FOR 2023

1. We make almost no opinionated decisions â€” the style sheet is designed to strip initial styles from browsers, providing a blank slate
2. No more Analytics, Modernizr, or jQuery
3. Basic CSS variables
4. Links to useful 3rd party tools
5. Removed extraneous comments

## A note on font-sizing

We prefer `rem` for the simplicity; you will need to swap rems for `em` in the CSS if that's your style.

## Command-line installation:

```
bower install HTML5-Reset
```
